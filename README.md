## Recipes
The following recipes are intended to help you create and manage certain content on the homepage.
These recipes do not include concepts which are already covered in the [vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/) documentation.

### Person
To create a new person, navigate to the `src/.vitepress/data/persons` folder using the console or the IDE.
A file with the following schema should be created there: `<lastname>-<firstname>.mjs`.

The content can be created in the same way as the existing persons.
The content of such a file could look like this, for example:

```ts
import { TeamID } from "../../domains";
import { definePerson } from "../../domains";

export default definePerson({
    avatar: 'https://www.github.com/tada5hi.png',
    name: 'Peter Placzek',
    team: TeamID.TBI,
    title: 'Researcher',
    links: [
        { icon: 'github', link: 'https://github.com/tada5hi' },
        { icon: 'twitter', link: 'https://twitter.com/tada5hi' },
        { icon: 'linkedin', link: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-placzek-047a74210/' },
    ],
});
```
